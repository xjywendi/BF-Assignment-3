3. Data Collection Methodology 
I collected this data from the Yahoo finance website. Although this data should be in a daily basis, in the Yahoo finance website, 
I changed the frequency to monthly so it would be easier to compute. I have also chosen within the five years of stock data.


4. Why does this data set intrigue you?
My family have stocks from Apple, so it would be interesting to see how i can forecast about this data. Also I uses many of apple products, it would be 
interesting to see how much increase of a stock and happen when they release a new price, and we can forecast in future purposes.
